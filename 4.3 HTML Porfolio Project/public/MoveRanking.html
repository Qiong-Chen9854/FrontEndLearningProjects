    <h1>The Best Movies According to Qiong Chen</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
    <p>This is surely one of the finest of all animated films, and it has its foundation in the traditional bedrock of animation, which is frame-by-frame drawing. Miyazaki began his career in that style, but he is a realist and has permitted the use of computers for some of the busywork.</p>

    <h3>The Pledge</h3>
        <p>Sean Penn's "The Pledge" begins when it seems his protagonist's career is ending. Jack Nicholson plays Jerry Black, a Nevada police detective whose retirement party is interrupted by news of the brutal murder of a young girl. Across the noisy room he senses a shift in tone, and joins a conversation between his chief and the man who will be taking over his job. Then he goes along to the murder scene, perhaps out of habit or because he hasn't officially retired. The little girl in a red coat is a pitiful sight with her blood staining the snow.</p>
    
    <h3>25th Hour</h3>
        <p>It follows a drug dealer, Monty Brogan (Edward Norton), who lives out his last day as a free man before beginning his prison sentence on drug distribution charges. </p>
